## Installation
Make sure you've installed the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), if you have not already.

### Windows
1. Download `RevDB.bat`
2. Enjoy! Run the script when you need it.

### MacOS
1. Download `RevDB.sh` to an easily accessible directory like Documents or Desktop.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your script.
3. Run `chmod +x RevDB.sh` to make the script an executable.
4. It's now set up! Run the script with `sh [path to script]/RevDB.sh` or `right-click + Run in Terminal` in your preferred file manager.

### Linux

1. Install `git` from the terminal if you haven't already.
2. With any terminal, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/lukemurdock/RevDB`.
3. Run `chmod -x ~/RevDB/RevDB.sh` to make the script an executable.
4. The repository should've cloned to your home directory. Navigate there and move `RevDB.desktop` to the desktop or another easily accessible directory.
5. Run `RevDB.desktop` to start the script in your default terminal.

## Troubleshooting 
If you're having trouble on Windows, please submit an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can. I'm running Linux currently, so I would have to be on Windows to debug the batch file.
